Built a reusable reference dataset and toolkit to standardise salivary proteome profiling and accelerate biomarker discovery across studies using the capillary electrophoresis technique.

- Curated multi-study salivary proteomics reference (PRIDE submissions), harmonised metadata, and defined QC gates for comparability.
- Shipped a software toolkit for feature extraction, differential analysis, and panel selection with documented, reproducible workflows.
- Enabled cross-cohort comparisons and faster hypothesis testing for oral/systemic disease links; published methods and dataset for community reuse.
