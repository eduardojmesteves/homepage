Developed and validated a saliva pooling strategy and lightweight data platform to scale regional COVID-19 testing while preserving sensitivity and operational throughput.

- Co-designed pooling protocols (pool size selection, deconvolution logic, QC gates) and defined acceptance criteria with wet-lab leads.
- Implemented real-time data capture with role-based access, audit trails, and dashboards; built Python analytics to track positivity rates, Ct distributions, and pool performance.
- Demonstrated operational feasibility and efficiency gains; streamlined sample flow, triage, and reporting across sites.
- Wrote SOPs and training guides; reduced failure modes and handover friction between collection, lab, and reporting teams.
- Published peer-reviewed results; packaged protocol + data model so other labs could replicate/adapt at low cost.
