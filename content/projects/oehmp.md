Co-founded a platform to capture, store and visualise longitudinal oral-health data (clinical records, omics, observations) in a FAIR-aligned, reproducible way.

- Designed the data model and ingestion pipelines; enforced consent, de-identification, and access controls from day one.
- Implemented dashboards for longitudinal trends, cohort segmentation, and outcome tracking; enabled reproducible analytics via versioned notebooks.
- Established FAIR practices (findable metadata, interoperable formats, open documentation) to support research on disease progression and prevention.
