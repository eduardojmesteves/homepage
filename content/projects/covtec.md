Co-led the design and rollout of a saliva-based RT-qPCR testing workflow for UCP, replacing swab dependency with a safer, cheaper, high-compliance alternative and enabling campus surveillance during COVID-19.

- Designed end-to-end saliva diagnostics workflow (collection → barcoding → RT-qPCR → reporting), with SOPs, QC gates, and audit-ready documentation.
- Coordinated clinicians, wet-lab, IT, and governance to meet ethics/GDPR requirements; implemented consent, de-identification, and secure result delivery.
- Built lightweight LIMS/data pipeline for sample tracking and turnaround, improving traceability and handovers between lab and reporting teams.
- Trained staff and students; authored quick-start guides and troubleshooting playbooks to stabilise operations and reduce failure modes.
- Supported university surveillance strategy (return-to-campus readiness), demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of saliva testing in real-world conditions.
