Prototyped a low-cost, offline-tolerant process-confirmation system for factory lines using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and an ESP32 watch.

- Standalone mode: Arduino-only proximity/condition sensing for quick confirmation where connectivity is flaky.
- Hybrid mode: Arduino + ESP32 watch for user prompts, acknowledgements, and buffered sync when the network returns.
- Implemented event logging, basic de-duplication, and retries to survive poor connectivity.
- Demonstrated applicability across gravity-based lines, manual progression lines, and fixed workstations with a working prototype during the hackathon.
