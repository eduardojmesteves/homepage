Co-led a saliva proteomics study to characterise host response in COVID-19, combining MS-based profiling with multivariate modelling and network/context enrichment to surface dysregulated pathways and novel protein associations.

- Designed end-to-end analysis: sample prep, LC-MS/MS acquisition, QC, and downstream stats (PLS-DA) with pathway enrichment (FunRich) and interactomics (OralInt).
- Mapped disease biology by integrating protein changes with functional categories and oral interactome context for interpretability.
- Reported 5 dysregulated biological processes and 10 proteins not previously linked to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms.
- Authored methods and reproducible workflows; documented parameters and decision points for auditability and reuse.
- Coordinated with institutional stakeholders and lab teams; synced outputs with the saliva testing platform built in Odoo (LIMS-style tracking and reporting).
