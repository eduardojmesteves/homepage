Profiled saliva during clear-aligner therapy using shotgun proteomics and 16S rRNA, integrating clinical metadata to characterise host–microbiome shifts over time.

- Collected longitudinal saliva samples across treatment phases; standardised collection, storage, and batch controls.
- Performed 16S rRNA community profiling plus proteomics to map microbial shifts and host-response signatures.
- Identified temporal changes in taxa and pathways; highlighted interactions relevant to caries risk, inflammation, and treatment protocols.
