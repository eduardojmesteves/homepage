**Problem.** Industrial process confirmation in assembly lines and workstations is often unreliable in environments with poor internet connectivity. Bosch Portugal set the challenge of creating an autonomous and automatic system that could overcome these constraints.  
**Approach.** Designed and prototyped a solution using **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense sensors** for proximity and condition monitoring, paired with an **ESP32 watch** for communication and user interaction. Two deployment modes were created:  

  1. **Standalone mode** with only Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for lightweight confirmation.
  2. **Hybrid mode** combining Arduino + ESP32 for broader connectivity and user feedback.  
**Outcome.** Delivered a functional prototype during the Hackathon that demonstrated **low-cost IoT feasibility** for industrial process validation. The design was applicable across **gravity-based assembly lines, manual progression lines, and fixed workstations**.
