Built clinician-friendly dashboards and data models to assess data quality, compliance, and outcomes in real time.

- Designed KPI dashboards in Apache Superset/Metabase with drill-downs for cohort, visit, and patient-level views.
- Modelled health-questionnaire and blood-panel data in PostgreSQL; defined QC rules (ranges, missingness, duplicates) and data contracts.
- Implemented governance traceability: data lineage notes, owner/approver, change logs, and audit trails.
- Shortened data-to-insight cycles by standardising extracts and creating self-serve views for clinicians and study coordinators.
